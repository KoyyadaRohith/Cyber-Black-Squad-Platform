# 🛡️ Cyber Black Squad — Startup Workspace Platform

A modern workspace platform that helps teams manage projects, organize tasks, collaborate with team members, communicate efficiently, and track progress from one centralized dashboard.

## 🎯 Overview

**Cyber Black Squad** is a modern startup workspace platform built with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Supabase, and PostgreSQL. It provides a centralized environment for project management, task tracking, team collaboration, analytics, notifications, and role-based workspace operations. It provides a complete workflow for startup team collaboration:

- Secure authentication + role-based access control
- Project management with status tracking
- Task management (priority, due date, status)
- Team chat with message persistence
- Profile management (avatar + details)
- Admin tools for user oversight and monitoring
- Analytics and notification support

The UI is responsive and designed to work well on desktop and mobile.

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Access Control
- Registration and login
- Session management
- Role-based permissions (Founder / Admin / Manager / Team Member)

### 📊 Dashboard & Analytics
- Overview of projects, tasks, and activity
- KPI-style metrics (implementation varies by module)

### 📁 Project Management
- Create, edit, and delete projects
- Track project status (e.g., Active/Completed/On Hold)
- Assign team members

### ✅ Task Management
- Create tasks and assign them to users
- Priority and due date fields
- Status tracking (e.g., To Do / In Progress / Completed)
- Automated notifications when applicable

### 💬 Team Chat
- Persisted chat history
- Typing indicators / presence (depending on implementation)
- Message notifications

### 👥 User Profiles
- Edit profile fields
- Avatar customization
- Social/skill/department info (where supported)

### 📢 Notifications
- In-app notification center
- Unread badge/bell indicator

### ⚙️ Admin Panel
- User management
- Audit/monitoring views
- Admin-only system controls (where supported)

## 🤝 How It Works

- `index.html` acts as the app entry point.
- After login, the app switches to the authenticated views (e.g., `dashboard.html`).
- Data is securely stored and synchronized through Supabase and PostgreSQL. Authentication, user management, projects, tasks, notifications, messaging, and workspace operations are managed through cloud-based services with real-time synchronization capabilities.
